# Barks and Rec

![welcome to barks and rec banner](./src/images/banner01_crop.png)
_Developed by Tracie Masek_ 

Barks and Rec is a role-based user app that facilitates communication about the adoption process between an animal rescue or shelter and its potential adopters.

Adopter users can submit an application to adopt, and track its status. Adopters can learn more about the dogs that are up for adoption and can favorite dogs they have an eye on.

The rescue admin users can add, edit, and view adoptable dog profiles. Admins can view registered adopters, and review their applications for adoption approval based on a task list generated by each application submission. Once an admin completes a task, the corresponding adopter's application status is updated accordingly.

# Getting Started

Please find the repo for the backend at [Barks-and-Rec-API](https://github.com/traciemasek/barks-and-rec-api). You'll first need to follow the instructions on the README for the API in order to spin up the server, establish a JWT secret, and seed some starter dogs and admin client. Note: the API calls require you to start the Rails server on port 3001 to communicate with the front end `rails s -p 3001`

## Prerequisites 

Clone down this repo and after you have the backend cloned and the server running, install the associated dependencies with either `npm install` 

Then you can start running the program with `npm start`.

## NPM Packages
  * moment
  * react-actioncable-provider: ihollander/react-actioncable-provider*
  * react-dom
  * react-router-dom
  * redux
  * react-redux
  * redux-thunk
  * semantic-ui-react

*react-actioncable-provider has a bug that makes it unsubscribe any time the parent component rerenders, use fixed version until PR is merged: `npm uninstall --save react-actioncable-provider && npm install --save ihollander/react-actioncable-provider`
